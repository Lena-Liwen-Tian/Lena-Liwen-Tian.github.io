            An Analysis of the Leveraged Loan Market
            </h5></a>
          <p style="text-align:justify"class="card-text">Abstract: Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) produce long-term low-risk bonds backed by
            leveraged loans. To increase safe debt capacity, CLO managers commit to dynamically
            maintaining portfolio quality through selling low-quality loans and buying high-quality
            loans. This paper develops an equilibrium model in which CLOs endogenously arise
            and shows that this commitment generates investment and financing externalities across
            asset managers in the leveraged loan market. As a result, the market has too many
            CLOs, but under-produces safe assets relative to a constrained efficient benchmark.
            Policies targeting only one side of intermediary balance sheets, including the Credit
            Risk Retention regulation, exacerbate the welfare loss.</p>

            (with Xiang Kang)</h5>
          <p style="text-align:justify" class="card-text">Abstract: We show that trading suspension, a regulatory rule that temporarily restricts stock trading,
            generates stale mutual fund net asset values (NAVs). Using a sample of 3,205 long-lasting
            suspension events in China between 2004–2018, we find that opportunistic investors exploit
            transformed liquidity and allocate capital based on firm-specific news and fund portfolio
            holdings: Abnormal flows positively respond to suspended stocks’ unrealized impact on
            NAVs. Trading suspension generates short-term profits at the cost of long-term investors, and
            portfolio disclosure plays a key informational role in distorting flows. Our findings suggest
            that trading regulations can have unintended spillover effects on non-targeted markets.</p>

              Costly Information Acquisition and Investment Decisions: Quasi-Experimental Evidence</a>
            <br/>
            Abstract: Despite a vast theoretical literature that builds on costly information acquisition, there is no direct
            evidence on the role of information costs in investors’ private information choices. Using
            a large sample of Chinese mutual fund managers’ visits to firm headquarters and exploiting the
            introduction of high-speed railway as a quasi-natural experiment, I find substantial and quick
            responses to exogenous cost shocks: A one-standard-deviation travel time reduction increases
            site visits by 28% of the average frequency and semiannual stock trading profits by CNY 1.4
            million at the fund family—firm pair level. These findings demonstrate investors’ elasticity to
            information costs.</p>
