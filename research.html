            <!-- This paper develops an equilibrium model in which collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) issue safe and risky securities backed by dynamic portfolios of leveraged loans.
            Consistent with empirical evidence, the endogenous market structure consists of two groups of financial intermediaries: CLOs and lenders that do not securitize loans.
            Trading with non-securitized lenders allows CLOs to issue larger safe tranches ex ante but generates price pressure in downturns.
            Since intermediaries do not internalize their effect on loan prices, there is excessive entry into operating CLOs, and the market underproduces safe assets. 
            A recent regulation that reduced CLO entry could exacerbate the inefficiency. -->
            By committing to maintain portfolio quality, institutions can create more safe debt, but are obligated to replace deteriorated collateral assets. 
            This paper analyzes such dynamic collateral management in an equilibrium framework that endogenizes institutions' assets, liabilities, and secondary market trades.

            Shutting down stock trading does not stop investors from producing information - at least when transformed liquidity is provided by financial intermediaries. 
            Mutual fund investors do react to mispriced fund shares when underlying stock holdings experience suspension.
            <!-- Trading suspension, a widely adopted regulatory rule, prevents information from being incorporated into stock prices.
            Using a sample of 3,205 long-lasting suspension events between 2004-2018, we show that mutual funds holding suspended 
            stocks generally fail to adjust for stale prices, generating stale net asset values (NAVs).
            We find that investors exploit predictable fund performance that quickly realizes after trading resumes: 
            flows positively respond to firm-specific news about suspended stocks in fund portfolios. Portfolio disclosure plays a key informational role in distorting flows.
            Our findings suggest that regulatory interventions on trading activities can create negative externalities among mutual fund investors.

              An empirical setting where acquiring private information can literally cost days.
              <!-- Using detailed data on company visits by Chinese mutual funds, we provide direct evidence of mutual fund information acquisition activities and the consequent informational advantages mutual funds establish in local firms. 
              Mutual funds are more likely to visit local and nearby firms both in and outside of their portfolios, but the ease of travel between fund and firm locations can substantially alleviate geographic distance constraints. 
              Company visits by mutual funds are strongly associated with both fund trading activities and fund trading performance. 
              Our results show that geographic constraints and costly information acquisition amplify information asymmetry in financial markets.
