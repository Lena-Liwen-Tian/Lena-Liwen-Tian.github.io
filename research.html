            Financial Market Structure and the Supply of Safe Assets:
            An Analysis of the Leveraged Loan Market</a> (Job Market Paper)</h5>
          <h6 style="text-align:justify"class="card-text"><b>Abstract</b>: Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) produce long-term low-risk bonds backed by
            leveraged loans. To increase safe debt capacity, CLO obligates the manager to dynamically
            maintain portfolio quality through selling low-quality loans and buying high-quality
            loans. This paper develops an equilibrium model in which CLOs and other nonbanks endogenously arise
            and shows that this contract generates investment and financing externalities across
            asset managers in the leveraged loan market. As a result, the market has too many
            CLOs, but under-produces safe assets relative to a constrained efficient benchmark.
            Policies targeting only one side of intermediary balance sheets can exacerbate the welfare loss.</h6>

             (with Xiang Kang)</h5>
          <h6 style="text-align:justify" class="card-text"><b>Abstract</b>: 
            Trading suspension, a widely adopted regulatory tool that temporarily restricts stock trading, generates stale mutual fund net asset values (NAVs). 
            Using a sample of 3,205 long-lasting suspension events in China between 2004–2018, 
            we show that opportunistic investors exploit transformed liquidity and select funds based on firm-specific news: 
            flows positively respond to suspended stocks’ unrealized impact on NAVs. 
            Trading suspension creates predictable short-term returns at the cost of long-term investors, 
            and portfolio disclosure plays a key informational role in distorting flows. 
            Our findings suggest that trading regulations can have unintended spillover effects through financial intermediaries.</h6>

              Costly Information Acquisition and Investment Decisions: Quasi-Experimental Evidence</a>
            <br/>
            <b>Abstract</b>: Despite a vast theoretical literature that builds on costly information acquisition, there is no direct
            evidence on the role of information costs in investors’ private information choices. Using
            a large sample of Chinese mutual fund managers’ visits to firm headquarters and exploiting the
            introduction of high-speed railway as a quasi-natural experiment, I find substantial and quick
            responses to exogenous cost shocks: A one-standard-deviation travel time reduction increases
            site visits by 28% of the average frequency and semiannual stock trading profits by CNY 1.4
            million at the fund family—firm pair level. These findings demonstrate investors’ elasticity to
            information costs.</h6>
